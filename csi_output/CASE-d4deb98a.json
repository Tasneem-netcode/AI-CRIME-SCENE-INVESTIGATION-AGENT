    "description": "A one-bedroom apartment was discovered in a state of disarray late at night. The main door showed signs of forced entry, with broken glass scattered on the floor. An overturned chair was found near the dining table, and multiple blood stains were visible on the carpet leading toward the bedroom.  Inside the bedroom, a blood-smeared knife was recovered near the bed. Muddy footprints were observed near the entrance and along the hallway, suggesting a possible escape route through the rear stairwell. No firearm evidence was found at the scene.",
