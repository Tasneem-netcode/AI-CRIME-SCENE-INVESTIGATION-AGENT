## Scene Description

A street-side jewellery store reported a break-in after the alarm system was triggered shortly after midnight. The front glass display window was shattered inward, and multiple jewellery items were reported missing.  Inside the store, glass shards were scattered across the floor. A trail of blood was observed leading from the display counter toward the storage room at the rear of the shop.  A metal crowbar and a single black glove were recovered near the safe. Blood smears were visible on the counter edge, and the cash register was found open.  Investigators noted signs of movement after injury, suggesting the suspect may have sustained a wound during the incident.
