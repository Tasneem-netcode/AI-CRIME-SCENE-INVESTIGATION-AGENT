    "description": "A narrow alleyway behind a commercial block was cordoned off after a late-night incident.\r A middle-aged male victim was found lying on the ground near a trash dumpster.\r A large pool of blood was present near the upper torso area.\r \r Two spent shell casings were recovered several feet from the body.\r A broken wristwatch and scattered personal items were found near the victim,\r while his wallet and mobile phone were missing.\r \r Faint shoe prints were visible on the damp concrete surface,\r leading toward the main road where skid marks suggested a rapid vehicle departure.\r No knife or blunt weapon was recovered at the scene.",
